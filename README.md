The Password Generator Project in Python is designed to create secure and customizable passwords. It allows users to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their passwords. By utilizing Python's random module, the project generates strong, unpredictable passwords, enhancing security. Users can opt for either a non-randomized version (Easy Level) or a more secure version where the order of characters is shuffled (Hard Level). The project also showcases efficient use of lists and string manipulation, with the added option of randomizing character order for a stronger password.
